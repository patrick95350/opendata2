## Health & Open Data Education

Your main goal as an Ambassador is to paint a picture for both government officials and local communities that clearly shows how health data can inform policy discussions, raise public awareness of issues, and even directly improve people’s lives. Spreadsheets filled with immunizations rates and asthma rates on their own can’t solve California’s health problems. Your job is to tell the story about how newly available data can create products and tools tailored to your community’s local needs that have the potential to not only improve government health services, but also lead to the creation of healthier communities up and down the state. You should see yourself as an extension of the state, given that they can’t dig deep into particular community needs, regularly communicating community feedback to them.
